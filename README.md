This information extraction application takes in text documents, classifies them based on topic, and extracts useful information to be displayed to the user. The classification is done using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis), and the language processing is executed with GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering).

To use, simply run IEApplication.java and enter in your text. The system supports text classification and information extraction in both English and Spanish for disasters including earthquakes, plane crashes, train accidents, and terrorism.

This information extraction application takes in text documents, classifies them based on topic, and extracts useful information to be displayed to the user. The classification is done using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis), and the language processing is executed with GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering).

To use, simply run IEApplication.java and enter in your text. At the moment, the system supports text classification in both English and Spanish of Earthquakes, Aviation News, Train News, and Terrorist Attacks, and can extract information from English earthquake reports and Spanish aviation reports.
